Work with layers in Anypoint Vizualizer.

== Adding an API, Application, or Proxy to a Layer

There are two ways of classifying a node to a layer--in the application's properties file, or through the UI.

=== Setting the Layer Through Properties
To automate the classification of nodes into layers, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>` in the application's properties file.

When this property is used, the nodes automatically appear in the specified layer. If the layer doesn't exist it is automatically created. You can reassign a node layer through the Runtime Manager UI.

[NOTE]
For applications deployed to standalone Mule runtime engines, layer names set using runtime properties can contain only alphanumeric characters. Unsupported characters are replaced with `\_`.

== Setting the Layer Through the UI

You can set the layer at deployment time using the Runtime Manager UI or API. By default, when you view an environment using Anypoint Visualizer, none of the nodes in the application are assigned to a layer. You can assign a node to an existing layer. The following procedures are also applicable for changing the layer of a node.

. Select the application node to add to a layer. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply layers to all the selected nodes at once. +
+
_Result_: The *Customization* panel for the node appears in the right side of the panel as shown in the following image:
+

. In the *Customization* panel, expand the drop-down list next to *Layer* as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-layer.png[Select Layer]

. Select the layer you want from the drop-down list.

_Result_: The node you selected appears within the layer as shown in the following image:

== Create a New Layer

In addition to the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, you can create new layers to customize the view of your application network.

. Select the node to add to a new layer.
. From the drop-down list in the *Customization* panel, select *New Layer*.
. Enter a name for your layer in the dialog box, then click *Create Layer*. +

_Result_: The node appears in the new layer. You can add additional nodes to the new layer as necessary.


== Delete a Layer

You can delete layers from Anypoint Visualizer as required. Deleting a layer does not delete the node.

. In the Visualizer display, click inside the layer. Do not click a node within the layer.
. Click the *Delete Layer* icon above the *Details* panel.
+

. Click *Delete Layer* to confirm.

_Result_: Anypoint Visualizer automatically adjusts the network display. Nodes that were part of the deleted layer no longer have a layer assigned.

== Reorder Layers
You can reorder the layers from Anypoint Visualizer:

. In the Visualizer display, click inside the layer. Do not click a node within the layer.
. Use the arrows in the *Details* panel to move the layer up or down relative to the other layers.
